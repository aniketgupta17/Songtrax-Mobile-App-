# Songtrax-Mobile-App
Overview

In the React Native App assessment (the 2nd part of the Cross-Platform Project), you’ll build interactive native apps with a cross-platform JavaScript framework (React Native), testing with device simulators (iOS & Android). The native app will communicate with web & device APIs that are shared across the Cross-Platform Project. Throughout, you’ll evaluate the design, implementation & architecture for delivering a complex native app. Previous work towards the React Web App assessment will inform this part of the Cross-Platform Project.

Learning Objectives

After successfully completing this assessment, you should be able to in part:

1. Apply an intermediate knowledge of functional programming with vanilla JavaScript.
3. Build interactive native apps with a cross-platform JavaScript framework, testing with device simulators (iOS & Android).
4. Communicate with web & device APIs that are shared across web/native apps.
5. Apply consideration of user interface (UI) principles & user data privacy for web/native apps.
6. Evaluate the design, implementation & architecture for delivering complex, cross-platform web/native apps.
7. Develop customised testing regimes for evaluating design, code & security of cross-platform web/native apps.
What Am I Building?

For this assessment, you’ll be building the mobile app portion of the Cross-Platform Project using React Native & dependencies. 

Your task is to build both a web app & a mobile app for a music & location based experience similar to Pokémon GO. The app is called SongTrax. In the web app, users will create music samples to be shared to a location (saved to an API). In the mobile app (built in A3 - React Native App), users can experience these music samples by physically visiting each location (read from the API).

With this app, you’re asked to demonstrate all of what you’ve learned & practiced in Lectures & Contacts until Week 12. This includes, but is not limited to:

Creating a React Native project and running it via either the iOS simulator or Android emulator.
Building React Native components in a nested & modular fashion (across multiple files), enabling navigation/routing (via React Navigation) for multiple, linked screens.
Using JSX to combine React Native components & JavaScript logic together in an appropriate manner.
Using states & hooks in React Native to read & transform data, including reading, writing to and filtering data from the provided RESTFul API.
Integrating a native map with location markers and the user’s current location.
Integrating a controllable webview to play sounds via Tone.js in a webpage.
Integrating device APIs to get a photo from the device’s image picker.
